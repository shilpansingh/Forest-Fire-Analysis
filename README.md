# Forest-Fire-Analysis

Abstract: 
This is a preliminary data analysis document that explores the relationship between the occurrence of forest fires and various temporal and environmental variables.
Dangerous flames have burned more than 9 million acres of land. In a sparsely inhabited forest area, it is challenging to anticipate and detect forest fires, and it is even more challenging if the prediction is made using ground-based techniques like camera or video-based approaches. Due to their dependability and effectiveness, satellites can be a valuable source of data both before and during the Fire.
In certain places, like Siberia, California, and Australia, wildfires are among the most frequent natural disasters. Particularly vulnerable regions are those with Mediterranean climates and those in the taiga biome. Globally, human activities have worsened wildfires compared to how they would occur naturally, with a doubling of the amount of land destroyed by wildfires. Due to climate change and other more direct human activities like changing land use and suppressing wildfires, humans are a major contributor in the increase in wildfires, increasing heat, and dry times.

Objective: 
Inform future research into the causes of forest fires in forested areas prone to wildfire incidents. To address the topic of forest fire vs. global warming and global climate change, it is crucial to investigate forest fire occurrences and the climate of any place.
